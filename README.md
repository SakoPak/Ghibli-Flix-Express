## About Me

Hi, I'm Sako Pak, a former photographer turned software engineer.
I love the intersection of where art and tech collide and am currently studying full time at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, learning how to build beautiful experiences and powerful programs through the magic of a machine.

Thank you for looking at my work!
